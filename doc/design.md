# MongoDB Fund Data Controller Design Document

## Overview
This module is designed to manage time series fund data using MongoDB. It provides a reliable and efficient way to upload, manage, and retrieve financial data.

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. MongoDB Connection Manager (`mongodb_connector.py`)
- Manages database connections and connection pools
- Implements connection error handling and retry mechanisms
- Provides connection configuration via environment variables
- Ensures proper connection cleanup and resource management

#### 2. Data Model (To be implemented)
- Time series data structure for fund data
- Schema validation rules
- Index definitions for optimal query performance

#### 3. Data Upload Controller (To be implemented)
- Data validation and sanitization
- Bulk upload capabilities
- Error handling and rollback mechanisms
- Upload status tracking

#### 4. Query Interface (To be implemented)
- Time series specific query methods
- Aggregation pipeline templates
- Data export capabilities
- Query optimization

## Database Design

### Collections
1. Fund Data Collection
   - Time series data structure
   - Indexed by timestamp and fund identifiers
   - Optimized for time-based queries

### Indexes
- Timestamp-based indexes
- Fund identifier indexes
- Compound indexes for common query patterns

## Error Handling
- Connection errors
- Data validation errors
- Query timeout handling
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures

## Performance Considerations
- Connection pooling configuration
- Bulk operation optimization
- Index strategy
- Query optimization
- Data pagination

## Security
- Environment-based configuration
- Connection string security
- Access control implementation
- Data validation and sanitization

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for database operations
- Performance testing
- Error handling tests
